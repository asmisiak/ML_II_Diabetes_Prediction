## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

#### **Why Diabetes Prediction Matters**
Diabetes prediction is a critical public health priority with far-reaching implications for healthcare systems worldwide. Diabetes affects hundreds of millions of people globally and is a leading cause of serious complications including heart disease, kidney failure, blindness, and lower limb amputations. Early detection and intervention can significantly reduce these risks and improve patient outcomes. Machine learning models for diabetes prediction enable healthcare providers to identify at-risk individuals before symptoms appear, allowing for timely lifestyle interventions and preventive care. This proactive approach not only improves individual health outcomes but also reduces the substantial economic burden on healthcare systems by preventing costly complications and hospitalizations. Furthermore, accurate prediction models can help address health disparities by identifying vulnerable populations and enabling targeted screening programs, ultimately contributing to more equitable healthcare delivery.

#### **Project Objectives**
The primary objective of this project is to develop and evaluate machine learning models for predicting the onset of diabetes using a comprehensive dataset of patient health metrics. We aim to implement and compare various algorithms, including Gradient Descent and Neural Networks, to identify the most effective approach for accurate diabetes prediction. Key goals include:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Identify and create relevant features that enhance model performance.
3. **Model Development:** Implement Gradient Descent and Neural Network models, optimizing hyperparameters for improved accuracy.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and compare results across different algorithms.

#### **Dataset Overview**
The dataset includes patient profiles with features based on demographics, lifestyle habits, family history, and clinical measurements that are well-established indicators of diabetes risk. All data is generated using statistical distributions inspired by real-world medical research, ensuring privacy preservation while reflecting realistic health patterns. The dataset contains 100,000 patient records with the following features:
- **Patient Personal Information:** Age, Gender, Ethnicity, Education Level, Income Level, Employment Status
- **Lifestyle Factors:** Physical Activity Level, Dietary Habits, Smoking Status, Alcohol Consumption, Sleep Hours, Screen Time
- **Family Medical History:** Family History of Diabetes
- **Personal Medical History:** Hypertension, Cardiovascular Disease, BMI, Waist-Hip Ratio
- **Clinical Measurements:** Fasting Blood Glucose Level, Insulin, HbA1c Level, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol Levels (LDL, HDL, Triglycerides)
- **Outcome Variable:** Diabetes Diagnosis (Yes=1/No=0)
